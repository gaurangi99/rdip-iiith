<p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. Hypertext signifies that the all of the text is linked. Markup is for telling that all the text is marked up on the webpage like heading, paragraph, images, links, tables, etc. Language is used to tell that it communicates with the system. The HTML document only tells what will be on the web page and what is what like heading, paragraph, links, etc. It does not tell, at all, how the web page will look, that is not the job of HTML.</p>
