DHTML is dynamic HTML, so as the name suggests it is used to make dynamic webpages. It is accepted mostly by all the latest browsers. It is on the server-side unlike HTML which is on the client-side. It is a mix of technologies like HTML, CSS, JS & DOM (Document Object Model). HTML does not provide any kind of animations but with DHTML along with animations & gaming, dynamic fonts are also possible. They have files with extension .dhtm, unlike .htm/.html for HTML files. It also uses database connectivity which is not present in HTML or it does not need that. DHTML is used for real-time positioning, data-binding & gaming applications. It uses few lines of code to do all of this, without any hassle. The file size is very less & downloads faster on client-side.
